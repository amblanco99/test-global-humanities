                <p class="align-center">The Global Humanities Certificate invites students to step beyond borders—intellectual, cultural, and creative—to explore what it means to be human in a rapidly changing world. Through interdisciplinary study of literature, art, philosophy, and history, the program encourages critical thinking and creativity by engaging students with global perspectives in three main areas: how cultures shape ideas, how imagination and the arts connect people, and how stories and histories reveal and reshape our collective identities.</p>
